# Scapy Network Scripts

A collection of customized network sniffers built with Python's **Scapy** library, along with demonstrations of network attacks using **Mininet**. Ideal for learning packet manipulation, traffic analysis, and simulated attacks in a controlled environment.

## Overview
This repository includes:
- **Custom Network Sniffers**: Capture and analyze network packets using Scapy.
- **Attack Simulations**: Execute network attacks to understand vulnerabilities in a safe environment.

## Features
- **Network Sniffing**: Build customized sniffers to capture and analyze traffic.
- **Simulated Attacks**: Perform attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and session hijacking.
- **Custom Topology**: Includes `hub_topo.py` to create a hub-and-spoke Mininet topology, ideal for centralized traffic analysis and interception.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Scapy library
- Mininet (for network simulation)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/medTrigui/Scapy-Scripts.git
   cd Scapy-Scripts
